\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We present a novel algorithm for computing singular values and vectors called bisection and twisted (BT) algorithm, 
which is implemented on both single GPUs and a multi-GPU platform.
The experimental results show that BT outperforms a number of existing
work on SVD acceleration. %Additionally, BT's scalability is excellent:
One of the major advantages for BT algorithm is its scalability:
we are the first to perform SVD on a matrix of 1 million by 1 million,
using only two GPUs. In the near future, we plan to extend our multi-GPU version of BT
with network middleware such as MPI so that BT algorithm can be further 
extended to distributed GPUs.
%scaled with GPU clusters.
